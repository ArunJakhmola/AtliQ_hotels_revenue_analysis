## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the hospitality sector, operates multiple five-star hotels across India. Despite their long-standing excellence, recent strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making have led to a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment. To address these challenges, the managing director has decided to leverage “Business and Data Intelligence” for strategic insights. This project involves analyzing historical data to regain market share and optimize revenue.
